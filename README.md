# StereoKit Template for dotnet 6

## How to use

Open the solution in Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider

Press "Debug" to build and debug, and launch in Flatscreen mode if no VR kit is connected.

If any VR kit is connected it will automatically launch in VR


## How to iterate fast!

```pwsh
dotnet watch --project "StereoKitDotnet/StereoKitQuickStart_NetCore.csproj"
```

Using this command the code will automatically compile, apply changes (even without restart sometimes) and start new if the change needs a restart!
